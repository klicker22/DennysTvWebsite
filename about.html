          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Denny's Radio &amp; TV was founded in 1974 by Denny Klick.
            Denny's philosophy was providing great service to the people
            of Thorp, Wisconsin and the surrounding area who required electronics
            repair and sales. When Denny opened his business he started with one
            antenna, a tube caddy, and a single distributer of electronic devices.
            Throughout his 41 years in business, Denny's knowledge and resources
            changed but his philosophy has stayed the same. Now, 41 years later, Denny
            has a great inventory of electronic items for purchase, parts for easy
            repairs, and multiple distribution resources to order from. Because of
            this, Dennyâ€™s Radio &amp; TV has been a steady community known source
            of electronics sales, service, and repairs.

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As the proprietor, Denny Klick has over 41 years of experience in
            the electronics field. Besides his formal training in electronics repair,
            Denny has continued his training to keep current with technology
            giving him the ability to have a wide array of knowledge about all
            aspects of electronic repair. In addition to his electronics knowledge,
            Denny strives to make his customer experience positive no matter the
            repair, service, or sale. No matter the level of knowledge his guests have,
            Denny ensures they walk away happy and informed.
